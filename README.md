# Democracy Coin
My little crypto currency experiment. An entire blockchain system written from scratch in C#.

## Coin Node
A node for the blockchain. The node can mine, sync with other nodes, send money and maintain the blockchain.  
Start as public node: `./CoinNode`  
Start without hosting: `./CoinNode nohost noseed`  
Start miner: `./CoinNode mine`  
Start wallet: `./CoinNode wallet`
